1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,307
But

2
00:00:00,307 --> 00:00:00,615
the

3
00:00:00,615 --> 00:00:00,923
words

4
00:00:00,923 --> 00:00:01,230
out

5
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:01,538
of

6
00:00:01,538 --> 00:00:01,846
his

7
00:00:01,846 --> 00:00:02,153
mouth

8
00:00:02,153 --> 00:00:02,461

9
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:02,769
something

10
00:00:02,769 --> 00:00:03,076
that

11
00:00:03,076 --> 00:00:03,384
I

12
00:00:03,384 --> 00:00:03,692
have

13
00:00:03,692 --> 00:00:04,000
never,

14
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,307
ever,

15
00:00:04,307 --> 00:00:04,615
ever

16
00:00:04,615 --> 00:00:04,923

00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:05,538
a

19
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:05,846
church

20
00:00:05,846 --> 00:00:06,153
before

21
00:00:06,153 --> 00:00:06,461
and

22
00:00:06,461 --> 00:00:06,769
I

23
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:07,076
will

24
00:00:07,076 --> 00:00:07,384
never

25
00:00:07,384 --> 00:00:07,692
forget

26
00:00:07,692 --> 00:00:08,000
them.

27
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
He

28
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
says,

29
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,400
nobody

30
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:12,800
comes

31
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,200

32
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:13,599

00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,200
they've

37
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:15,599
done

38
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,000
wrong.

39
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,600
You

40
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,200
already

41
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:17,800

42
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,400
all

43
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:19,000
that.

44
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,666
And

45
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:20,333
I

46
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:21,000

47
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,666

00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:23,000
what?

50
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,444
He's

51
00:00:23,444 --> 00:00:23,888
like,

52
00:00:23,888 --> 00:00:24,333
I

53
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:24,777
don't

54
00:00:24,777 --> 00:00:25,222
care

55
00:00:25,222 --> 00:00:25,666

00:00:26,111 --> 00:00:26,555
done

58
00:00:26,555 --> 00:00:27,000
wrong.

59
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,285
God

60
00:00:27,285 --> 00:00:27,571
already

61
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:27,857

62
00:00:27,857 --> 00:00:28,142
what

63
00:00:28,142 --> 00:00:28,428
you've

64
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:28,714
done

65
00:00:28,714 --> 00:00:29,000
wrong.

66
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,666
He

67
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:30,333
doesn't

68
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:31,000
care.

69
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,800
He

70
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,600
just

71
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,399

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,000
heart.

74
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,299
And

75
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:38,599
this

76
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:38,899
is

77
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:39,199
the

78
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:39,500
same

79
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:39,799
reaction

80
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:40,099
I

81
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:40,399
have

82
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:40,699

83
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,000
day.

84
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Like

85
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
what?

86
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,666
He

87
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:44,333
loves

88
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:45,000
you.

89
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What?

90
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,428
What

91
00:00:47,428 --> 00:00:47,857
do

92
00:00:47,857 --> 00:00:48,285
you

93
00:00:48,285 --> 00:00:48,714
mean

94
00:00:48,714 --> 00:00:49,142

00:00:49,571 --> 00:00:50,000
me?

97
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,285
Then

98
00:00:50,285 --> 00:00:50,571
where

99
00:00:50,571 --> 00:00:50,857
the

100
00:00:50,857 --> 00:00:51,142
hell

101
00:00:51,142 --> 00:00:51,428

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,399
It

105
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:52,799
was

106
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:53,199
what

107
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:53,600
I

108
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,000
said.

109
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,636
That

110
00:00:54,636 --> 00:00:55,272
one

111
00:00:55,272 --> 00:00:55,909
sentence

112
00:00:55,909 --> 00:00:56,545
was

113
00:00:56,545 --> 00:00:57,181
enough

114
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:57,818
for

115
00:00:57,818 --> 00:00:58,454
me

116
00:00:58,454 --> 00:00:59,090
to

117
00:00:59,090 --> 00:00:59,727
stop

118
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:00,363
and

119
00:01:00,363 --> 00:01:00,999
consider.

120
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,399
He

121
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:01,799
just

122
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:02,199
wants

123
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:02,600
my

124
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,000
heart.

125
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,571
He

126
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:04,142
just

127
00:01:04,142 --> 00:01:04,714

00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:06,428
want

131
00:01:06,428 --> 00:01:07,000
him.

132
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,388
So

133
00:01:07,388 --> 00:01:07,777
all

134
00:01:07,777 --> 00:01:08,166
the

135
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:08,555
decisions

136
00:01:08,555 --> 00:01:08,944
that

137
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:09,333

140
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:10,500
just

141
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:10,888
was

142
00:01:10,888 --> 00:01:11,277
there

143
00:01:11,277 --> 00:01:11,666
waiting

144
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:12,055
for

145
00:01:12,055 --> 00:01:12,444
me

146
00:01:12,444 --> 00:01:12,833
to

147
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:13,222
turn

148
00:01:13,222 --> 00:01:13,611
to

149
00:01:13,611 --> 00:01:14,000
him.
